# Onyx: GSC De-Hash Database Tool

**Onyx** is a tool written in C# that greatly simplifies the work of GSC developers. It is essentially a very useful database that converts the unreadable function, method, and variable names found in decompiled GSC files from recent COD games (func_XXXX, method_XXXX, var_XXXX) into their original, clear, and understandable names, complete with additional information such as parameters for functions and methods.

# Supported Games

Onyx currently supports the following titles:

**S2** (World War II)

**H1** (Moderne Warfare Remastered)

**IW7** (Infinite Warfare)

# Notes
### Customization : You have direct access to the JSON files (even in the compiled version), allowing you to modify and update the databases as needed. Feel free to contribute or adjust the data for your own projects!

### Ready to Use Executable : For those who only want the compiled version, the executable file is available here :  **[➡️ Releases](../../releases)**.
