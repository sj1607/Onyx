# Onyx: GSC De-Hash Database Tool

**Onyx** is a tool written in C# that greatly simplifies the work of GSC developers. It is essentially a very useful database that converts the unreadable function, method, and variable names found in decompiled GSC files from recent COD games (func_XXXX, method_XXXX, var_XXXX) into their original, clear, and understandable names, complete with additional information such as parameters for functions and methods.

# Supported Games

Onyx currently supports the following titles:

**S2** (World War II)

**IW7** (Infinite Warfare)

# Note

### Ready to Use Executable : For those who only want the compiled version, the executable file is available here :  **[➡️ Releases](../../releases)**.
